    <p> A well-preserved 17 century Portuguese fort, Fort Aguada is located on the Sinquerim Beach in North Goa. Built as the chief defence of Portuguese against the Dutch and Marathas, it was the most prized and crucial fort of the Portuguese. The fort is ringed by thick battlements and a deep dry moat. Some buildings of the fort are still in good shape having been converted into a jail and interestingly, it happens to be the largest jail in Goa.</p>

  <p> Churches in Goa are an important legacy of it being an late Portuguese colony. Built across centuries, these architectural wonders were more than just a place of worship; they hold a place of historical or cultural significance as well. One of the popular churches in Goa is the Basilica of Bom Jesus. The mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier is preserved here in this Basilica and hence revered by many. It also is an UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<div style="color: #ddd; background-color: #282E34; text-align: center; padding: 50px 80px; text-align: justify;">
  <p> About 9 kms to the south of Bicholim town in North Goa is located the 6th century Pandava cave complex and Arvalem waterfalls. The cave complex is divided into 5 compartments and the ‘linga’ enshrined in the middle compartment is held in great reverence by devotees here. Another attraction close to the Pandava or Arvalem caves is the Arvalem waterfalls. The water cascading down from a height of 50 mts makes for an awesome view, and there is a park nearby from where you can view the waterfall as well as the lake at the bottom.</p>
